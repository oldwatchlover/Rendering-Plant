The "Rendering Plant"


This is a framework that fits around 3D rendering code, handling all the "boring stuff",
geometry and scene parameter input, state management and the first portion of a graphics
pipeine (3D transformations, etc.)

It's flexible enough to support many different synthetic image rendering algorithms (I've
included 3 different algorithms built on librp.a)

I made the first verison of this a while ago to support multiple projects I was working
on with different constraints - I've found it useful to maintain as a "work bench" for
playing with 3D rendering.

The name is a humorous (and slightly digusting) pun, but is appropriate as this code can
be thought of as a "place to go where the rendering happens" and you don't really want to
know all the details of what happens when something gets "rendered" ...
